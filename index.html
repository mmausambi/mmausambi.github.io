<div class="note">
  <h1>walk with us</h1>
  <h2>A journey through a fever dream</h2>




<p> Lopsided waffle cones peaking over a horizon of peppermint hills.
<span class="aside"> you feel small in the midst of towering mountains
</span>
</p>
<p>Foot fingers sinking softly into fluffed up gooey marshmellows ready for s'mores.
<span class="aside"> they cling onto your skin, every step an effort to wade through the goo </span>
</p>
<p>Steaming lakes of molten hot chocolate and cake.
<span class="aside"> careful not to sink into <em>those</em>
</span>
</p>
<p>A beach made of sev puri and chat masala, samosa shells and sweet red chutney.
<span class="aside">the scent of spices, your stomach rumbles </span>
</p>
