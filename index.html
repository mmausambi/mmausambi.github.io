    This is my (sprase) site for now!

<pre>
  Lopsided waffle cones peaking over a horizon of peppermint hills.
  Foot fingers sinking softly into fluffed up marshmellows ready for s'mores.
  Steaming lakes of molten hot chocolate and cake.
  A beach made of sev puri and chat masala, samosa shells and sweet red chutney.
